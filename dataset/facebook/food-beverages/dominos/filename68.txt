We just found this out after my daughter was hit by a lawsuit queen, tapping the back of her car, doing no damage but claiming damage to her car (from an old accident).  Not only is this the way that we found out that she didn't have special insurance (an extra 250..00 a month), but that she needed it. come to find out, this was known by the managers but never disclosed to the employees. This is wrong. What the drivers are paid cannot possibly be enough for commercial insurance, as well as dominos not picking up the tab for it--after all, they offer delivery. Shouldn't they have commercial vehicles of their own? Well, no as, you would rather pay people low and then, have them find out the hard way that, they aren't covered or backed up by Dominos, in the event of an accident. I hope those looking to work at Dominos read this and then does research on this being a problem since about 2009. Also, if you decide not to risk having the insurance, and work at the counter instead, your pay goes down to 7.25. Now, we had our insurance cancelled as, where she was hit while driving there, they consider her high risk and, the manager told her the only option was, to give a week notice and quit or work behind the counter for 7.25.  I am ordering from Sarpinos now and sharing the word everywhere, including FB.  Not only is this bad for the drivers, it's scary for those driving that could be hit and the driver will not be insured for any damage--or even worse, injury. Good luck trying to sue them.  They'll probably lose their job, and, even if they don't, they won't make enough to pay your claim.
