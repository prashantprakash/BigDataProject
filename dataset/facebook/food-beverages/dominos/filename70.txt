I range from 4.30 onwards approx 10 times to try and order a pizza. The first time I asked to pay by card and have deliver to outside the old town branch which I was told I was unable to do. So I looked up the postcode for suju and called back. I was then told it needed to be to a residential address and before I could provide further details the person disconnected the call. I then called back with a residential address and the person claimed he could not hear me and hung up. I called again and he claimed not to hear me and hung up. I was shouting down the phone and people were looking because he said he could not hear me still yet others could clearly hear me and were shocked to hear what they were doing. I asked my friend to call on her phone and firstly they claimed not to know bath road which is a well known road in swindon. He hung up on her without her being able to explain the road location, although we gave the correct postcode. My friend called back and they again said they could not hear her. All the while I wanted to pay by card. All I wanted was a pizza and I felt extremely frustrated at the way we were treated. I work as a manager in customer service myself and I would certainly never hang up on a customer and if the phone rang 1 minute before closing time the call would be answered and delat with appropriately however long it took. I understand they close at 5am but I was calling from 4.30 and feel the customer service received has been appalling. All I wanted was my pizza and I have now gone hungry as I spent so long trying to get a dominos pizza which is ultimately what I wanted but clearly not what they wanted to provide. I would like to know what you can do with reagards to this. I clearly will not get a pizza now but I would like this to be put rigHt. Kind regards.

Surprisingly, All the links told me that Domino pizza is the first choice rather than the well-known twenty-seven years Operate specialized pizza restaurant “ pizza hut “.\n I will naturally pick your Domino pizza over Pizza Hut (and other pizza delivery) after the Review I saw on those links. Also, I went to your website and is satisfied with the menu your company provided, compared to other delivery website, your company website is easy to be understood and clean/neat.\n\n So, on 24 July 2014 same day 6.23pm. I called the Hot Line to order pizza, the first guy who answered my call asked for my name, Address and Second hand phone number. I told him that I want to place an order because I am so hungry! But the unexpected reply was, he told me that I would need to wait for One hour or more to place an Order due to Peak hours and outlet was busy.  So, I understand and waited for 1 hour and 15 Minutes and call back on 7.38 pm. This time was a girl who answered my call, she ask for my name and immediately she replied me with my address, I confirmed it and she replied if I want to order, I have to wait another 1-2 hours waiting time. The reply literally ignite my flame deep from my hunger stomach (including my friend) and lots of Burning question from my mind. I told her “that I called one hour ago to make an order and now I have to wait another 1-2 hours again? “And some burning question but all she can’t replied is “Sorry Sorry Sorry, I am sorry sir. The Nearest outlet to your Place is only Bukit Merah outlet.” From the way she replied, I know there is no point arguing anymore. (Both the service staff is polite and profession) \nFor the conclusion, \n1.) I know your company have 15 Outlets (stated from your website) in Singapore and I am living in Commonwealth drive, there is West coast And Jurong outlets which also consider near to my house. I really don’t understand with my location, why only entitled to one outlet for delivery?\n2.) I place an order on a weekday and it is not even weekend, why have to wait such a long timing instead taking down my order first and put it onto priority queues? Or call to other outlet to check if they are free for my order?\n3.) Your Pizza Company receive such a good review on internet, but is this the way how your delivery system work or trying to prove?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-07-25T04:25:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150417295824957_10150420824269957","from":{"id":"866888800023453","name":"Virgie Lestari"},"message":"indonesia people like too,...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-07-23T14:20:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150417295824957_10150420540144957","from":{"id":"10205736401824503","name":"Karim Youssef"},"message":"PROMOTION DE L'ETE !\nTu as entre 19 et 45 ans ?\nPour tout 3 ème pilier conclu, recevez la dernière tablette Samsung 3 ou le dernier i-Pad mini.

I am putting my complanint here with this hope that someone from your side will take an action and help me out regarding this case .I asked dominos to deliver 2 pizza mania and 1 garlic bread along with Tako Indiana at my home but they refused the delivery saying that it will be delivered only if we order at least 4 pizza mania or a medium pizza. I dont understand this because there is always the minimum order price given by every vendor but minimum order quantity of pizza this is something I am experiencing first time and that too from a Brand like Dominos. This strategy is followed by new or cheap vendors who want to increase there selling or make more money but something like this is not accepted from brand like Dominos which is already a established chain since last many years and is also successful . If I am giving an order of Rs.250 or more say of 500 or of even 1000 $ and want to have only 2 pizza mania in that ,why the hell on the earth they are forcing me to order atleast 4 pizza mania ..If I want to have 2 I will have two moreover who the hell will eat the remaining one .. This is something very cheap and disgusting and more over very dissapointing when it comes from a brand like Dominos . I want you to plz look into this complaint seriously since it will not only affect the reputation of the brand but will also break the relationship of consumers with such brand .. However I am mentioning the name of the Dominos branch who gave me this information on asking for the delivery ..ItsDominos Pizza in Noida Sector 18. I know its in India , hence it would be bit difficult for you to reach the chain but I am complaining here on this website because I know that you guys take care of your customers all over the world , whether they are in India or Africa hence I request you to kindly give me a feedback on my number +919871676309 regarding this or kindly place a minimum order price  on home delivery so that customers are not forced to have the thing which they dont want to but enjoy something from Dominos which they really want to

They have been found to be highly social, intelligent, and curious, they engage in complex tasks, form cooperative social groups and feel pain, fear and stress. Studies have proven that they are more intelligent than dogs and even some primates, and scientists have demonstrated that pigs are capable of playing simple video games, learning from each other, and even learning names. So how is it that a majority of breeding pigs in the U.S. are confined in “gestation crates” for virtually their entire lives. For several years, they’re confined to crates that almost immobilize them, enduring a cycle of repeated impregnation. These individual cages are approximately 2 feet wide and are so small the animals are unable to turn around or take more than a step forward or backward. Because of the amount of time and the severity of their confinement, these pigs’ suffering is one the worst of all factory farmed animals. Companies such as Domino’s should not allow this and consumers should not buy the product of such horrific suffering. Other fast food places have stopped the practice of using gestation crates for their pregnant pigs but Dominos continues.
