I think it is a lot of crap if you ask me, I will not buy from the domino's a real rip off. The lady manager said she made it and that the reason for no sauce was do to pizza getting cold. I have bought pizza before and this is not true, very false and misleading for me to stop being a customer, if this is how it is ran, I will go somewhere else and spend my money who appreciates a good customer. I used to like you guys in Vancouver WA, even the cold pizza. I do not like to be lied too. The late night manager is a real piece of work, the day manager who I asked for was off and does make good pizza.

I used to like you guys in Vancouver WA, even the cold pizza. I do not like to be lied too. The late night manager is a real piece of work, the day manager who I asked for was off and does make good pizza.
