Two weeks ago my organization called Pizza Hut asking for a pizza donation. The manager said she would have 5 Large pizzas delivered for our cancer research fundraiser at 12am. The day of the event I called to inquire about the pizzas when they did not arrive. First the worker made me wait nearly fifteen minutes to speak to a manager after she said that they had no such order. When I finally got on the phone with a manager he was so disrespectful and rude, yelling at me that they don't donate pizzas. As I was trying to speak to him and resolve the situation he instead decided to hang up on me. Many of our cancer survivors and event participants were looking forward to this pizza and instead I had to tell them that it was not possible. This people have suffered through so much already and alls I wanted was to see them smile and happy. I have never been more disrespected by a business. I am embarrassed for pizza hut and I will never again buy from pizza hut. I am as well informing everyone I know and will be posting this across social media sites.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-04-12T02:45:22+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10153099697107415_10153101746912415","from":{"id":"830194423714039","name":"Lupita Hil"},"message":"Are pizza hut managers trained to argue with customers?

That's not the only thing hiding in your pizza. I was taking a bite of pizza, and I look down and see this long, hard plastic laying on the pizza, I then spit out what was in my mouth, and more of the hard black stuff was in my bite. I've never had something like that happen. Besides the occasional hair it had the last time I orders one. Seriously disgusting. Very annoyed and disappointed. Idk what this is, but it's not meant to be there. I'll post a pic too. I showed my husband,  who snapped it in half. So it's not long looking since he broke it.
