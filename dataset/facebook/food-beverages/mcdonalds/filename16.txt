Me and my girlfriend (being the smart shoppers we are) decided to split a Big Mac and large soda, we handed the manager handling the register a 20 dollar bill, as we were sitting we saw your coupon for a dollar large fry, and I wanted it bad, so I asked my lady for an extra dollar to spend , at that point we realized we were missing ten dollars, and our Reciept said we only paid with a ten, we approached the cash register, with understanding that mistakes happen, we explained to the lady what had happened, and that we were okay with it, I kept my cool, but your manager refused to believe any word of what I had to say, and only took what I had to say into consideration to get me out of her store after yelling at me and calling me a liar not only in front of my girlfriend but Infront of many customers. I work customer service myself, and if I ever treated someone like that I would be without a job.

What I know won't be on the survey is what I saw today with respect to a new hire. This girl wearing a pair of gym shorts and a tank top that both clearly was a bit to small for her full figure came in to get her new hire orientation instructions.  The 1st thing that came to my mind was, I deserve $15/hour to be a McDonald's employee.  The 2nd thing that came to my mind was, if that girl didn't feel it was appropriate for her to have to dress for her new job hire process, then how am I to trust her with my food.  More importantly, the manager who was talking with the new hire STILL apparently kept her as a new hire. That exemplified a \" slackness \" about McDonalds.  Not sure if I am going back.  My husband does NOT ( been 3 years now ) go to McDonald's bc of a negative experience he had.  I'm strongly considering becoming an ex-McDonald's patron.  $15/hour?

I don't normally come in and berate companies, but some of your employees crossed the line.  Going out and deliberately stopping traffic so they can demand $15.00 an hour AND union representation requires a quick and decisive action on the part of McDonald's.  THESE SPOILED ROTTEN PUNKS NEED TO BE FIRED!  PERIOD!!!  THEY REPRESENTED McDONALDS WHEN THEIR STUPIDITY BOILED OVER.  I won't eat one more item from McDonald's until you do this.  Frankly, your food leaves a lot to be desired.  While some things may taste good, hardly any is healthy.  Your jobs are at the very bottom tier when it comes to employment.  Frankly, you should have an exception from minimum wage laws and pay no more than $5.00 an hour.  A full 25% of all collage grads make $27,000 or less starting out, yet your little geniuses think they deserve to be paid $28,800 to assemble hamburgers.  These kids were given everything to them their whole lives.  They apparently think cell phones, Play Stations, games, those late night pizzas...are all free.  They think it's their right to drive a new car and have a fancy place to live.  REALITY...A DEPLOYED E-5 IN THE MILITARY (yeah, you know, the ones getting shot at) MAKE CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN 5 DOLLARS AN HOUR!  That's with 10 years of service.  That group makes up the bulk of the military, across all the branches. IN MY EYES, THEY HAVE THE MOST HONORABLE PROFESSION IN THE ENTIRE NATION!!!  But some punks out of high school thinks he and she should be making $15.00 an hour?  Your employees are already making more per hour than those they serve in your numerous restaurants located on our military installations.  The only reason our military members take home larger paychecks is that military members work 24/7, 365!  They don't go home and get to crawl into a nice warm bed at night, snuggle up with their Teddy or Tammie bears like your employees do.  This insults every fiber of my being.  And I say that because I CAN...I'M QUALIFIED TO MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT!!!  I'm a disabled Veteran with 21 years of experience in the Navy.  So until I see a news broadcast telling the nation that McDonald's is apologizing to the American people for the actions of some of their employees AND those who actively participated in this crap are FIRED (including the ring leader who organized all this crap), I WON'T BE GOING INTO ANOTHER McDONALDS AGAIN!!!

After Oliver showed how McDonald’s hamburgers are made, the franchise announced it will change its recipe.\n\n According to Oliver, the fatty parts of beef are “washed” in ammonium hydroxide and used in the filling of the burger. Before this process, according to the presenter, the food is deemed unfit for human consumption.\n\n According to the chef and presenter, Jamie Oliver, who has undertaken a war against the fast food industry: “Basically, we’re taking a product that would be sold in the cheapest way for dogs, and after this process, is being given to human beings.”\n\n Besides the low quality of the meat, the ammonium hydroxide is harmful to health. Oliver calls it “the pink slime process.”\n\n “Why would any sensible human being put meat filled with ammonia in the mouths of their children?” asked the chef, who wages a war against the fast food industry.\n\n In one of his initiatives, Oliver demonstrates to children how nuggets are made. After selecting the best parts of the chicken, the remains (fat, skin and internal organs) are processed for these fried foods.\n\n The company, Arcos Dorados, the franchise manager in Latin America, said such a procedure is not practiced in the region. The same applies to the product in Ireland and the UK, where they use meat from local suppliers.\n\n In the United States, Burger King and Taco Bell had already abandoned the use of ammonia in their products. The food industry uses ammonium hydroxide as an anti-microbial agent in meats, which has allowed McDonald’s to use otherwise “inedible meat.”\n\n Even more disturbing is that because ammonium hydroxide is considered part of the “component in a production procedure” by the USDA, consumers may not know when the chemical is in their food.\n\n On the official website of McDonald’s, the company claims that their meat is cheap because, while serving many people every day, they are able to buy from their suppliers at a lower price, and offer the best quality products.\n\n In addition, the franchise denied that the decision to change the recipe is related to Jamie Oliver’s campaign. On the site, McDonald’s has admitted that they have abandoned the beef filler from its burger patties.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-08T21:33:19+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152261521027014_10152262138532014","from":{"id":"10205657972585241","name":"Heather LaShea Williams"},"message":"Do some research...look up pink slime in there Food & human meat in there Food...there was over 300 bodys found in a meat truck at there meat processing factory...there is even a guy from there company that said (we tell people its in there Food and they still eat it, they eat there lost children, friends & family members, while out looking for them.)

After Oliver showed how McDonald’s hamburgers are made, the franchise announced it will change its recipe.\n\n According to Oliver, the fatty parts of beef are “washed” in ammonium hydroxide and used in the filling of the burger. Before this process, according to the presenter, the food is deemed unfit for human consumption.\n\n According to the chef and presenter, Jamie Oliver, who has undertaken a war against the fast food industry: “Basically, we’re taking a product that would be sold in the cheapest way for dogs, and after this process, is being given to human beings.”\n\n Besides the low quality of the meat, the ammonium hydroxide is harmful to health. Oliver calls it “the pink slime process.”\n\n “Why would any sensible human being put meat filled with ammonia in the mouths of their children?” asked the chef, who wages a war against the fast food industry.\n\n In one of his initiatives, Oliver demonstrates to children how nuggets are made. After selecting the best parts of the chicken, the remains (fat, skin and internal organs) are processed for these fried foods.\n\n The company, Arcos Dorados, the franchise manager in Latin America, said such a procedure is not practiced in the region. The same applies to the product in Ireland and the UK, where they use meat from local suppliers.\n\n In the United States, Burger King and Taco Bell had already abandoned the use of ammonia in their products. The food industry uses ammonium hydroxide as an anti-microbial agent in meats, which has allowed McDonald’s to use otherwise “inedible meat.”\n\n Even more disturbing is that because ammonium hydroxide is considered part of the “component in a production procedure” by the USDA, consumers may not know when the chemical is in their food.\n\n On the official website of McDonald’s, the company claims that their meat is cheap because, while serving many people every day, they are able to buy from their suppliers at a lower price, and offer the best quality products.\n\n In addition, the franchise denied that the decision to change the recipe is related to Jamie Oliver’s campaign. On the site, McDonald’s has admitted that they have abandoned the beef filler from its burger patties.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-08T21:33:56+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152260551552014_10152265756287014","from":{"id":"1597767087169970","name":"John Raulerson"},"message":"Yea y'all continue eating that infested crap.

I have 2 kids, and after a long and busy day,  we went through the drive through on the way home. I ordered one child a happy meal \"with monster high\" and the other child a happy meal \"with a hex bug\" . I rolled up to the payment window and was informed \"we are out of boy toys\" I confirmed, \"so.... Out of hex bugs?\" yes, no more hex bugs. I asked my child that wanted the hex bug if they wanted a monster high toy instead, and they said they did, so I told the employee \"OK, monster high will be fine\"  we got the food, drove away, and the child that originally wanted the hex bug discovered she has no toy at all. It was not a happy drive home for any of us, and the fact that McDonald's decided my child would be better off with no toy rather than the one intended for the opposite gender of the original request was extremely disappointing- especially when I specifically told the employee to give us a monster high toy instead. This is far from the first time I've had an issue at McDonald's over \"boy toys\" and \"girl toys\". Why do you continue to perpetuate such problematic stereotypes among your customers and employees?  Both of my children happen to be girls, and it's really irritating to continually see your \"boy\" toys focusing on robots, spy kits, and super heroes, and \"girl\" toys focusing on dolls, fashion, and animals. My girls have an interest in *all* of these things, and it's very disappointing that your company only offers toys based on strict and outdated stereotypes about what each gender should be interested in.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-10-13T03:17:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152240091517014_10152251562087014","from":{"id":"780629842051056","name":"Yash Borkar"},"message":"The burgers of Mcdonalds are awesome","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-02T16:07:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152240091517014_10152251477287014","from":{"id":"1628425440727109","name":"Azairyia Burkhart"},"message":"Dear McDonald's,\ntoday like every morning I walked down to mcdonalds to get a large caramel iced coffee, and like every morning I struggle to mix my own coffee because the caramel sweetening syrup is at the bottom.

We placed an order for a McMuffen with Sausage and a Bacon and Egg Biscuit. We were asked to move forward in the drive through so that they could prepare our order. About 15 minutes later our order was brought out.....The Wrong order to be more specific. The poor girl that brought it out was unable to explain or understand what had happened, so my wife took the order back into the store to get it corrected. After waiting about another 10 minutes the order was returned to her, again wrong. She waited again and this time, received the correct order. So I am in the car waiting all this time and by now some 40 minutes had elapsed since the order was first placed. When my wife returned to the car, I felt that way too much time had elapsed since placing the order. I took the order back into the store to get a refund and an apology neither of which I was at first granted. My wife had not received an apology either and I was upset at their lack of professionalism. They took even more time to discuss whether to even give a refund, which I did finally receive, though still without an apology being made by them. I asked for a receipt from the refund so that I would have a phone # to call and make a complaint, to which they told me they do not give out receipts for refunds. There were a couple of other customers standing there that had similar complaints as myself and they offered me the phone number on their receipt, but it was the number to the store I was in.  I was really upset by then, so I left before loosing my temper. If this was an occasional thing that happened to me, I would understand, but this happens more often than not when I visit this particular store. I do not appreciate having to take so much extra time just to get what are simple orders. Today was the last straw. I will NEVER return to this McDonalds again and most likely never return to any McDonalds. I am just so disappointed in how a business is managed and how customers are treated. I even tried to call the customer help line and it was closed due to this being Labor Day.

The manager also let a guy come back into the store and get a free refill on his drink which it a health hazard. I also didn't mention before I showed the manager the fry's they had a bucket in front of the fry's cooking full of nasty fry's The guy in front of me said \"you guy's got a lot of fry's that in that bucket that could have been used for a serving\"  SO I go up to the manager and I told her that I didn't like the fry's they are burnt and hard as a rock. She asked me for my receipt.  I gave it to her. She said that I've had the fry's for 30min and since I had them for that long I can't get a replacement since there only good for 7 min's. I would like for something to be done with this manager since all her and the other worker was doing was playing around and talking about stuff that should not have been said around kids. I called another store close by, they told me that NO I should have got a replacement, the fry's are only good on the stove cooking there for 7 min's b4 they got to get rid of them.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-01T01:02:19+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152240091517014_10152247674932014","from":{"id":"10152674964086534","name":"Tabitha Tomlinson"},"message":"Me and my dad love Mickey d's but yesterday we got ripped off on a very hot day.\n\nOne: no sign out front to tell us the milkshake machine was broken.

Again, I can ignore this, but the service and attitude from the person who took my order and money as disgusting, how I kept my cool I will never know. She was rude and did not say please or thank you, snatched the money, slammed the reciept on the tray. Meanwhile there was a cook at the back of the room poking his tongue out at customer. I asked for another straw as she has only given me one, she then slamned 10 on the tray and shouted something over her shoulder in Turkish whilst laughing, obviously to tell the others how funny she was as some giggled. Again, I just kept my cool, I actually laughed to the women next to me as it was sooo pathetic. There were two managers around who were also not doing anything and had seen this happen.People were waiting far too long for their food, because the staff were all standing around doing nothing!

It is the perfect drink for any occasion, and it makes me a happier person.\n       First thing in the morning, it provides a good sugar rush that allows me to jump start my day. Around mid day, a large cup of your sweet tea helps give me a push through to the lunch hour. It is so delicious.\n       Lunch would not be the same with a big cup of your sweet tea either. It goes with any meal. It helps wash the food down my throat, while coating my mouth with that delicious taste. Even if I were eating a cardboard box for lunch, as long as I am drinking your sweet tea, it is delicious. \n        When mid afternoon rolls around, and I am watching the clock, wondering if the day will ever end, a large sweet tea gives me hope, and guidance to make it through.\n       After work, a sweet tea is the perfect companion for the trip home. It will listen to how crappy your day at work was, without judging or pointing the finger at you. At the same time, it will calm and relax you as it trickles down your throat and brings a smile to your face.\n          By the time you get home, you are in a happy place. You forget all about the fact that your boss is a jerk, you should have been promoted already and that cute secretary doesn't even say \"Hi\"....\n          When you sit down for dinner, nothing gets you more excited to see on the table than a large McDonald's sweet tea. So your wife burned the meat loaf, her mashed potatoes are lumpy and there is no butter for the rolls? Who gives a crap? Just chase it down with your sweet tea and it is the best. Plus, when your wife asks you how is dinner, you can honestly say \"It's the best, thanks honey\" and you will not be lying.\n        When you wake up around 1:00 am needing to pee from all of the sweet tea you drank, nothing gets you more excited about having to walk to the bathroom than having a large sweet tea by the bathroom sink. This isn't potty time, its party time. A few swigs of that sweet nectar will put you in such a heavenly wonderland that you will drift right back to sleep and dream of a world where sweet tea fountains replaced water fountains, you could buy it by the gallon (hint) and sweet tea could run for president... - Rob Borden, Biker Atlas, Las Vegas, NV.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-28T09:20:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152238779102014_10152238857807014","from":{"id":"10200438469601533","name":"Cathy Delaune"},"message":"You did a great job congrats!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-27T21:59:31+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152238779102014_10152238802402014","from":{"id":"689042054557144","name":"Jennifer Mowrer"},"message":"Yummy good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-27T21:26:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152238779102014_10152238797577014","from":{"id":"450806655090383","name":"Lewie Sabatine"},"message":"Great job with the boys and good luck next year.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-27T21:23:58+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152238779102014_10152238781822014","from":{"id":"910304745700883","name":"Maya DeSantis"},"message":"Congrats","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-27T21:15:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152238779102014_10152268020577014","from":{"id":"392410444293108","name":"Ricky Lin"},"message":"Go Jackie Robinson and McDonalds!

I just got back from paying $3.50 for a large iced caramel mocha and what I got was a lukewarm watered down drink that is pretty much undrinkable. What's so embarrassing is that I have been ordering iced coffees for years and am usually very unsatisfied. But every time I get a good one, it makes me want to come back. I finally decided to switch to Burger King because the last time I ordered a large iced caramel coffee with extra caramel (bc if you don't order extra caramel it just tastes like unsweetened coffee) and it was so awful. We returned it to the store b/c it was warm, watered down, no taste except bitter coffee. We asked for a new one and they added a small amount of cream and gave it back to us. It was literally undrinkable and sat in my car as I attended church, which I was late to b/c of returning the drink. So this week I went to BK a couple times. The drinks were actually iced and fairly good but they are small. So today, feeling exhausted I decided to order the iced mocha caramel which is pricey but always is cold when I do order it. And I'm still exhausted b/c excuse me for not wanting lukewarm coffee. The sad thing is that I am ashamed to admit that I have probably wasted so many dollars on terrible iced coffee just hoping I would actually get one that tastes awesome. When they are cold and sweetened properly they are so good. I live in Ozark, MO and there is only one MCD there so it's not even like I can just switch to another one that does a better job. I can't believe the staff would actually hold something that feels warm in their hand to a customer who just ordered something iced cold. It is sad that the employees and manager just do not care about their customers or the product that they are serving. If you want to be competitive with a chain like Starbucks you are going to have to have a specific way that you make each coffee so they all taste the same every time. I have gotten terrible coffee after terrible coffee and never complained b/c I didn't think it would do any good. I am so frustrated today I finally had to say something.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-27T14:21:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152222499777014_10152238126507014","from":{"id":"980782518628870","name":"DeMart John"},"message":"Just watched an employee being advised by her manager to take my food order that they got wrong out of the garbage can she threw it in took it around back and put it in another container before giving it back to me.
