The problem with this is, I only went in 3 times. I was double charged on Monday, and then woke up this morning to see a pending transaction for the cost of my breakfast, even though I never went. Upon talking to the GM Jordan about it, he made it seem like it was my fault and someone had stolen my debit card. After informing Jordan that I live alone and only have 1 copy of my card that is in my wallet, he was rude about things and threatened to hang up on me. I explained to him that if he hung up on me, rather then answering my questions, I'd drive down there so we can talk face to face, so that way I would not be hung up on. Upon stating this Jordan informed me that he would be calling the police and have them there waiting for me to show up. I asked him again for an answer to some questions and was hung up on. \n\nUPDATE: The transaction mess was taken care of, however Jordans piss poor customer service still has me upset.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-10-31T20:30:00+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152366850847014_10152366852062014","from":{"id":"10205693131463078","name":"Rowena P Nonamer"},"message":"Awesome gr8 job","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-10-31T15:50:24+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152366850847014_10152374494607014","from":{"id":"966117350079421","name":"Jonnie Baker"},"message":"At the Seaside, OR, McDonalds about 10:15 am today, we ordered 1 bottled water @ $1.00 plus .05 deposit on the receipt, plus 1 sausage biscuit @ $1, 1 Sausage/egg/cheese biscuit meal @ $4.89 and, although the coffee came with the meal, the receipt showed \"1 Coffee @ $1.00.\"\n\nWhen we went back to question the extra $1.00 charge, the cashier said that,\nbecause the bottled water was entered first and with the sausage biscuit and because bottled water now costs $2.00 plus deposit, that first $1.00 charge was for the water.

I only do the drive-thru so by the time I actually get into the food, I'm already far away from the store, and I won't complain about a $1 burger anyways.

When you check in, in each room there is a stuffed animal waiting for the child play rooms with games, playroom with toys, a small library, tv rooms etc..the one we used to stay at even had a piano that they let my son play on happily and even brought out snacks and encouraged people to come listen to him so that he felt special.

What is your reaction to the movie Fed Up? How are you working to make sure your foods are not contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic and the rise of type 2 diabetes in children? I am fully aware that everyone is responsible for their own choices but in the movie we were told that people's minds are hijacked all day long by the media and advertising. It is difficult for kids to resist this influence and if they have a option to choose between a healthful salad with a healthy dressing and a quarter pounder with cheese, they are not going for the salad. In fact, you sell salads in your stores. How many people are eating those salads compared to the burgers and super-sized meals with the large sodas, fries, processed bread and other components? In fact, do you make a combo meal with a small burger, a salad, and a healthful drink for adults? I don't go in there very much but I don't recall ever seeing such a combo meal. Maybe it is available, I don't know but is it featured as prominently as the other combo meals so that people can have it in their face as much as the other items?

But, I do have these questions (I think I already know the answers): Is your beef derived from grass fed animals who are not treated with hormones or antibiotics? Do you get your beef from local farmers who use sustainable, humane practices? What about pork and chicken and eggs? Are these derived from pastured animals, no hormones or antibiotics, local farmers using sustainable, humane production methods? Is your meat treated with pink slime to prevent spread of bacteria? Are your vegetables purchased from local farmers who use organic methods, natural fertilizers, natural pest control? Is the flour in your burger buns and all baked goods derived from healthy whole grains or sprouted grains with all of the nutrients in tact? What about the amount of sugar used in your foods and what is the impact on the blood sugar of those consuming it? Are the ingredients used in creating your foods clean, organic, healthy from natural sources rather than processed, bleached, and foods devoid of nutrients? Are your dairy products at least derived from animals raised sustainably and from grass-fed cows even though it still legally has to be pasteurized? How much sugar is in the yogurt products? What about the fat used to fry your foods? Is it at least healthy fat -- beef tallow or fats derived from grass-fed animals? Is the food sold in your restaurants imported or purchased from at least local farms? Are you using coffee and teas from fair trade markets? Do you use non-GMO products in your food production and if you do, is it labeled as such? I am not even going to touch the soda because we all know the story on soda. If your answers to these questions is in the negative, what steps are you taking to move toward healthful, whole foods and to make the food people eat at least less toxic and more healthful to those who choose to eat it? How are you informing your consumers so that they can at least make informed choices about what they are eating?

When I asked to see a sign illustrating the prices for iced coffees, she replied \"there are no signs for iced coffees.\" This is absolutely unacceptable. When products are rung up for purchase, the last thing a customer wants to hear is that the price arbitrarily went up. This will be my final purchase from this establishment that is obviously a cash cow.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-30T13:46:31+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152299587532014_10152301256382014","from":{"id":"382775161926293","name":"Sharon Eide"},"message":"Thanks Mc D's!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-30T11:28:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152299587532014_10152300940217014","from":{"id":"943892628989839","name":"Kelvin M Garcia"},"message":"Hi Mcdonalds so i just got back home from buying a Mcdouble, Small French Fries and a Pie.

I picked up some food to take to my kids for lunch at school.  Well, my daughter opens her 4pc Chicken Nugget Happy Meal to find out that the 4pc Chicken Nuggets were not in there.  Let Down #1.  So I call the restaurant, and the manager I spoke to takes my name down and offers me 2 meals to pick up for dinner.  Fine.  I go to pick them up later, and the manager on duty tells me the manager I spoke to did not write my name down and that she had to call him to verify I spoke to him since he is the Store Manager.  I said fine.  She then say's she does not have his phone number and that I would have to call a different office to take this up with.  I find it very odd that a Manager would not have a phone number to contact the Store Manager.  Let Down #2.  I did not think it would be this much of a hassle for no more than $10 of food.
