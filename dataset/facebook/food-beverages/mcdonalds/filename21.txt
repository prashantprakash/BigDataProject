My boyfriend was approached by a homeless woman, who was visibly injured. She told us she was really hungry, and the manager at McDonalds would not let her in the store to purchase anything to eat. She asked us to go in and get her a hamburger and a large coffee. She reached into a sock and handed us $7.00 OF HER OWN MONEY. \n\nWhen I went into the McDonalds, I asked to speak with the manager, and asked why they would not allow her into the restaurant. The lady \"Maya\", said they would not allow her in there because she \"called their other manager a name\". \n\nIf you have a injured and hungry homeless woman, who has HER OWN money and is not begging, why wouldn't you let her in to buy something to eat?? The only reason I can come up with is, it was \"bad for business\" to have a homeless person in the facility, or they assumed she didn't have her own money, and would be begging for food.\n\nI am ashamed to have ever called myself a McDonalds customer, and I will NEVER return to your establishment.
